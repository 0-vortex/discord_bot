    "The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading. \\\n",

The beak's structure is composed of a foamy keratin material, reinforced with a network of bony fibers and drum-like membranes.

    "Avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation: the individual and the colony. Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes. \\\n",

The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading. \u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m\\\u001b[39;49;00m\n\u001b[0;32m     51\u001b[0m \u001b[39m        Discover 1\tThe Toco Toucan\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m'\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39ms beak is a marvel of natural engineering.

We have used X-ray microtomography to examine the test of Echinocardium cordatum (heart urchin), a burrowing cousin of the more commonly known sea urchins. Three dimensional imaging demonstrates that the bulk of the test is composed of only two distinct, highly porous, fenestrated regions (stereom), in which the thickness of the struts is constant. Different degrees of porosity are achieved by varying the spacing of the struts. Drawing an analogy to vertebrate trabecular bone, where for example, human bone has a connectivity density of ≈1/mm3, we measure up to 150,000 strut connections per mm3. Simulations of mechanical loading using finite element calculations indicate that the test performs at very close to the optimum expected for foams, highlighting the functional link between structure and mechanical properties. \u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m\\\u001b[39;49;00m\n\u001b[0;32m     64\u001b[0m \u001b[39m        Discover 2\tThe sea urchin\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m'\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39ms shell, or test, is a marvel of natural engineering.

Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels.

    "        The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading. \\\n",

    "        Avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation: the individual and the colony. Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes. \\\n",

    "\n",
    "        Avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation: the individual and the colony. Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes. \\\n",
    "        Discover 3\tHoneybees use a collective cooling technique to regulate the temperature of their hive. When the temperature inside the hive becomes too high, worker bees collect water and distribute it throughout the hive. Other bees then fan their wings to evaporate the water, which cools the hive. This is a form of evaporative cooling, similar to sweating in humans \\\n",
    "        Abstract 3\tThe essential feature that makes the honeybee's temperature regulation successful is its use of evaporative cooling. In design terms, we can describe this strategy as follows: \"A system uses a liquid (like water) distributed throughout its structure, and a method to promote evaporation, to cool the entire system.\" \\\n",
    "        Answer 3\tNow, let's apply this strategy to the design of a car engine: The car engine could be designed to mimic the honeybee's evaporative cooling technique. This could involve a system where a coolant is distributed throughout the engine. A mechanism (like a fan) could then promote evaporation, cooling the engine. This design could potentially improve the efficiency of car engines by better managing heat. \\\n",

Yet, many species are highly successful in these environments in part due to their ability to regulate intrinsic mechanisms associated with physiological stress and their metabolic demands. More recently, there has been a growing awareness that other extrinsic mechanisms, such as animal-associated microbial communities, can also influence the tolerance and survival of ectotherms under stressful conditions. The extent to which intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are functionally linked as part of the overall adaptive response of intertidal animals to temperature change and stress is, however, poorly understood. Here, we examined the dynamics and potential interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in the ecology of the tropical high shore rock oyster, Isognomon nucleus. We found that oysters modulate their internal biochemistry (PUFA-oxidised metabolites including 5-F2t-IsoP, 10-F4t-NeuroP, 13-F4t-NeuroP, and 16-F1t-PhytoP) as part of their adaptive regulation to cope with physiological stress during periods of extreme temperatures when emersed. While we detected extrinsic microbiome changes in alpha diversity, the overall taxonomic and functional structure of the microbiome showed temporal stability with no association with the host biochemical profiles. Our finding here suggests that the microbiome taxonomic and functional structure is maintained by a stable host control (not associated to the host biochemistry) and/or that the microbiome (independent of the host) is resilient to the temperature fluctuations and extremes. This microbiome stability is likely to contribute to the oyster, I. nucleus thermal tolerance, in addition to the intrinsic biochemical adjustment, to survive in the thermally challenging intertidal environment.Intrinsically Disordered Tardigrade Proteins Self‐Assemble into Fibrous Gels in Response to Environmental Stress by Anas Malki, J.

    "        The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading. \\\n",
    "        Discover 1\tThe Toco Toucan's beak is a marvel of natural engineering. Despite its size, it is incredibly lightweight and strong. The beak's structure is composed of a foamy keratin material, reinforced with a network of bony fibers and drum-like membranes. This structure allows the beak to absorb and distribute impact forces effectively, reducing the force that reaches the bird's body. \\\n",
    "        Abstract 1\tThe essential feature that makes the Toco Toucan's beak successful in managing impact is its unique structure: a lightweight, foamy material reinforced with a network of fibers and membranes. In design terms, we can describe this strategy as follows: \"A lightweight, porous material is reinforced with a network of fibers and membranes to absorb and distribute impact forces, reducing the force transmitted to the inner structure.\" \\\n",

This would involve creating a lightweight yet strong material that can absorb impact effectively. The material could be structured in a similar way to the beak, with a network of fibers for added strength and flexibility. This design could potentially improve the safety and efficiency of air travel by better managing impact forces. \\\n",

    "        The microstructure of many echinoid species has long fascinated scientists because of its high porosity and outstanding mechanical properties. We have used X-ray microtomography to examine the test of Echinocardium cordatum (heart urchin), a burrowing cousin of the more commonly known sea urchins. Three dimensional imaging demonstrates that the bulk of the test is composed of only two distinct, highly porous, fenestrated regions (stereom), in which the thickness of the struts is constant. Different degrees of porosity are achieved by varying the spacing of the struts. Drawing an analogy to vertebrate trabecular bone, where for example, human bone has a connectivity density of ≈1/mm3, we measure up to 150,000 strut connections per mm3. Simulations of mechanical loading using finite element calculations indicate that the test performs at very close to the optimum expected for foams, highlighting the functional link between structure and mechanical properties. \\\n",

      " Simple Summary The process of semen cryopreservation can have multiple advantages in an ex situ conservation program. However, there is a necessity to adapt the protocol to the specificity of each species. With that in mind, we aimed to optimize the sperm freezing/thawing process and study the effect of different cryoprotectants in the peregrine falcon. Abstract Sperm cryopreservation is a complex process that needs to be adapted to wild and domestic avian species to ensure proper efficiency. Because of its accessibility, the peregrine falcon may be used as a good model for studying other raptor species. To find the most optimal cryopreservation protocol for peregrine falcon ejaculates, sperm parameters such as motility, viability, DNA fragmentation, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial activity were analyzed under different conditions by varying the freezing method (slow freezing in straws vs. ultrarapid freezing in pellets), thawing conditions (37 °C for 30 s vs. 5 °C for 1 min), type of cryoprotectant (DMA vs. DMSO), and concentration of DMSO (4% vs. 8%). Results show that slow cryopreservation in straws yielded greater percentages (p < 0.05) of motile spermatozoa (22.5% ± 4.4% vs. 0.0% ± 4.1%), viable spermatozoa with intact acrosomes (84.6% ± 4.3% vs. 77.4% ± 4.3%), and spermatozoa with active mitochondria (41.0% ± 6.7% vs.12.8% ± 6.7%), compared with those obtained by the ultrarapid freezing in pellets. However, no differences were found between different thawing conditions. Moreover, all sperm motility parameters were greater (p < 0.05) when DMSO was used during freezing compared with DMA, although the use of 3% and 8% DMSO produced similar results. In conclusion, these results represent important progress in the study of falcon semen cryopreservation protocol, highlighting the crucial steps of the process and the most suitable conditions.\n",
